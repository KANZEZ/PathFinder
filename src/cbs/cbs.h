/*
 * A Header filed for implementing the Conflict-Based Search algorithm for Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding
 * Reproduce the code from paper: "Conflict-Based Search For Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding"
 * Used for only study and research purpose.
 *
 * OVERALL:
 * Conflict-Based Search, a.k.a. CBS, is a centralized, two-level algorithm. At the high level,
 * a search is performed on a tree based on conflicts between agents, at the low level, a search is
 * performed only for a single agent at a time, this allows CBS to examine fewer states than A* and
 * still optimal.
 *
 * PROBLEM DEFINITION:
 * given a graph and k agents with start and goal node, the objective is to return a set of action(wait or move)
 * so that each agent can safely reach their goal while minimizing a cost, for instance, makespan
 *
 * METHOD:
